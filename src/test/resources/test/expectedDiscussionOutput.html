<div class="sectionhead"><h3>Short term: Today through Sunday</h3>
<em>Issued at 328 AM CDT Sat May 16 2020</em>
</div>
<p>...Severe Weather Likely from Late This Morning into This
Evening...
</p>
<p>The main forecast concern in the short term remains rainfall amounts
associated with a passing shortwave and surface low. Early morning
water vapor imagery showed the shortwave of concern moving southeast
along the Montana/Wyoming border with an inverted surface trough
ahead of it producing some showers and storms in portions of SD, NE,
KS, and CO.
</p>
<p>The shortwave will continue toward the area today, with a surface
low deepening along the way. As it does so, expect a northward surge
of higher preciptable water air, with values getting into the 1 to
1.5 inch range across the forecast area by late this afternoon. That
said, morning soundings do show quite a bit of dry air to overcome
in the lower levels, so it will take awhile before any precipitation
actually starts to fall, likely holding off until the evening hours
when the actual wave gets a bit closer. As the low continues to
deepen, expect moisture transport to ramp up during the overnight
hours, with the nose wrapping around the north side of the surface
low and pointing into portions of southeast Minnesota and west-
central Wisconsin. Only expect a few hundred J/kg of MUCAPE to build
in across the area, but given the overall strength of the forcing,
most notably the strong isentropic ascent, would certainly expect
some thunder.
</p>
<p>Will need to keep an eye out for a stronger storm or two across the
far southern portion forecast area given modest shear and a surface
low in the vicinity, though with any stronger convection likely
holding off to the south and west until after midnight, time of day
isn't exactly favorable. Instead, the main concern with this system
will be rainfall amounts given the surge of moisture and
aforementioned strong forcing. Latest HREF guidance suggests a
fairly widespread 1.5 to 2 inches of QPF across areas north of I-90,
with some 3+ inch amounts at the nose of the strongest moisture
transport (southeast Minnesota into west-central Wisconsin). Just a
matter of exact location, as there remains some differences in
guidance regarding exactly how the moisture transport evolves into
Sunday morning (mainly impacting Taylor/Clark counties in the
forecast area). Some guidance suggests that moisture transport will
be more "through" these areas, continuing to point more into west-
central Wisconsin, while other guidance places the nose squarely
over them by late Sunday morning, though with overall strength
tapering off a bit. Farther south, expect drier air to eventually
wrap into the system and lead to lesser amounts across areas south
of Interstate 90, but still looking like 0.75 to 1 inch for them.
Given the recent dryness, not expecting much of a flooding threat,
with the only concern possibly being at the nose of the moisture
transport, where rainfall rates will be enhanced. But overall
should be a much-needed drink of water for most of the area.
</p>
<div class="sectionhead"><h3>Long term: Sunday night through Friday</h3>
<em>Issued at 328 AM CDT Sat May 16 2020</em>
</div>
<p>Any lingering precipitation (mainly drizzle) associated with the
low will push off to the east Sunday night/early Monday morning.
This will give way to dry conditions for much of the remainder of
the forecast period as an amplified upper level ridge/blocking
pattern sets up over the central CONUS. Warmer air will gradually
work in through the week, with 850 mb temperatures getting into
the upper teens and 20s C across the Dakotas into at least western
Minnesota. The question becomes how far east these warmer
temperatures extend into the forecast area. The 16.00Z GFS seems
to be quite the cold outlier when compared to most of the GEFS
members, with 850 mb temperatures over the forecast area in the 10
to 12 C range. GEFS mean would suggest more like 15 to 17 C...the
difference being highs in the 60s to lower 70s with the GFS to
fairly widespread highs in the 80s with the GEFS mean. Will
continue to side with model consensus, meaning highs in the 80s
for the latter half of next week. The next precipitation chances
arrive for the end of the week, but plenty of spread in guidance
regarding timing.

<div class="sectionhead"><h3>Aviation: For the 12Z TAFS through 12Z Sunday morning</h3>
<em>Issued at 646 AM CDT Sat May 16 2020</em>
</div>
<p>VFR conditions are expected through the daytime hours today with
deteriorating conditions tonight. A strong spring storm will
bring steady rains, abundant moisture, and occasional TSRA
overnight and into Sunday. This moisture will act to bring down
ceilings into the IFR/LIFR category by Sunday 12Z. Conditions are
not expected to improve much on Sunday in -SHRA.
</p>
<p>Thunderstorms are possible at both TAF locations tonight, although
coverage and confidence was still not high enough to include.
Storm track could influence TSRA inclusion somewhat.
